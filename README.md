This project employs Python, leveraging libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, to predict medical insurance costs using a linear regression model. Beginning with a thorough exploration of the dataset through Pandas and Seaborn for exploratory data analysis, the project proceeds to preprocess the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features using Scikit-learn tools. The core implementation involves training and evaluating the linear regression model, splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, and utilizing metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared for evaluation. Visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn are then employed to present the model's predictions and highlight the impact of different features on insurance costs. The README provides clear usage instructions for running the project locally, and the project encourages exploration, modification, and contributions, offering a comprehensive example of applying machine learning to real-world data for medical insurance cost prediction.
